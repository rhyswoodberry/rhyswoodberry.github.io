				<p>
						Welcome! If you’re reading this I’m assuming 
						you would like to know a little about me.
						I am a curious and creative person who enjoys 
						learning new things. For the past few years I was 
						studying a Bachelor of Arts part-time at Sydney University 
						and working part-time at Woolworths. I had explored several 
						areas of study at university, but was never completely 
						satisfied with what I was doing. This led me to explore options 
						outside of my familiar area of study and to what I am doing now, 
						a student at Coder Academy bootcamp in Sydney, where I have been 
						taking my first steps to my goal of becoming a full-time developer.<br/>
						<br/>
						Outside of work and study my main passion is video games. I really 
						like what games as a medium are capable of, the experiences that can 
						be created and the stories told. As much as I play for the enjoyment 
						of it, I like looking a little deeper and seeing how the medium can 
						be pushed in different directions to offer new ways of playing or redefine 
						what a video game can be.
						I have also been playing guitar and singing for about 15 years​,,​ I have 
						written and recorded several songs but I mostly prefer to jam along to my 
						favourite musicians or cover my favourite songs.
